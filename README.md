🛠️ Odoo Automation Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts intended for use with **Scheduled Actions** in **Odoo**, enabling automation of business logic, notifications, data updates, and more without the need for custom modules.

📌 About

These scripts are designed to be executed directly within Odoo’s **“Automated Actions” → “Execute Python Code”** feature, making it easy to automate workflows, maintain data integrity, and trigger time-based events.


> Each script is standalone and documented with usage instructions and dependencies (if any).

- 📨 Trigger emails or notifications
- 📅 Handle date-based events (e.g., overdue, expiry, follow-ups)
- 📊 Ensure data consistency across models
- ⚙️ Lightweight and plug-and-play

## 📜 Scripts

### **Stock_Quant_User_Validation.py**
Restricts specific users from adding new product lines in the Stock Quant (Inventory Adjustment) window. Only whitelisted users can add or modify products.

### **Sales_Order_Assign_Current_User.py**
Automatically assigns the current user to the "Sales Person" field when creating or updating sales orders.

### **Invoice_Auto_Confirm_PIDistribution.py**
Automatically confirms invoices created in the company "PI Distribution SRL" (ID = 12).

### **Odoo_Survey_to_CRM.py**
Converts survey responses into CRM leads with customizable field mappings.

### **Odoo_Event_to_Calender.py**
Syncs Odoo events to external calendar systems.

### **Odoo_Survey_to_Contact.py**
Creates or updates contacts based on survey responses.

### **Product_Price_Sync.py**
Synchronizes product prices across multiple companies or pricelists.

### **Product_Default_Code_Lock.py**
Prevents editing of the Internal Reference (default_code) field after product creation. Raises a validation error if anyone attempts to modify it, ensuring product codes remain consistent.

### **Survey to Tickets with Email and Priority.py**
Converts survey responses into helpdesk tickets with email notifications and priority assignment.

### **Product_Barcode_Validation.py**
Prevents duplicate barcodes in the `product.template.barcode` model by checking against both `product.template` (barcode and default_code) and other barcode lines. Ensures cross-model uniqueness.

### **Product_Template_Validation.py**
Validates uniqueness of both `barcode` and `default_code` (Internal Reference) fields in `product.template` by cross-checking with `product.template.barcode` records. Prevents conflicts across all product identifiers.
